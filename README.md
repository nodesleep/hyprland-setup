# My Hyprland Config
This is a modified clone of SolDoesTech's original Hyprland setup, found [here](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/hyprland)

## Changelog
Departing from the original SDT setup, I made the following modifications:

- Removed the wifi powersave prompt from the setup script
- Modified the configs to remove the bluetooth, unneeded network information, and reduced workspace count in the tray
- Updated the font to account for the improperly displayed icons
- Removed the ASUS-specific setup from the original installation script

## Installation
To install, simply clone the repo and run the ```set-hypr``` script.
